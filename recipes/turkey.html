    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>~12 lb Turkey</li>
        <li>1 medium onion</li>
        <li>1 stalk celery</li>
        <li>1 medium carrot</li>
        <li>2 tbsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>3 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>4 sprigs fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>1/2 bunch of sage</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place onion, celery, and carrot in a large, shallow roasting pan.</li>
        <li>Place turkey, breast-side up, on top of vegetables in the roasting pan. Pat outside and inside of turkey dry with paper towels.</li>
        <li>Combine salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in a small bowl. Season inside of turkey with about 1/3 of the salt mixture. Fold wing tips under bird.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat until edges turn golden, about 2 minutes. Add rosemary and sage; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Place rosemary and sage inside cavity of turkey; reserve melted butter. Tie turkey legs together with twine.</li>
        <li>Brush melted butter over turkey. Season with the remaining salt mixture.</li>
        <li>Bake turkey, uncovered, in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and juices run clear, about 3 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Remove turkey from the oven and allow to rest in a warm area for 10 to 15 minutes before slicing.</li>
    </ol>
